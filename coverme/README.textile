h1. Cover Me!

Meant to answer the question: "So how much coverage is that?"

Heck, I don't know. But probably a computer could figure that out. 

Turns out, its pretty easy for computers to remember this stuff.

These are all very simple calculations. 

Numbers could be wrong. Numbers might not be right for your problem.

Don't blame the numbers.
